        <p align="center"> My project was a brief study conducted during the summer in 2022 on Salamander abundance. More specifically, I chose to study the impact  of varying ecological landscapes on salamander abundance. I was selected to conduct this projec through the ACA where I was selected based on my application which conisted of an in-depth research proposal. Once I had collected all data, I cleaned and analyzed the data inside R. I created many occupancy models during my analysis and created a scatterplot to display my results which can be seen in the paper. My presentation of this project can be found <a href="https://www.acaweb.org/ledford-presentation-ethan-heck/">here.</a></p>.
