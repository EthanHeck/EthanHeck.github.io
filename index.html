    <p align="center">Welome to my portfolio! I am currently a Senior studying biology looking to pursue biostatistics. Below are some of my previous projects done in a variety of languages such as R and Python.

    <p align="center">This <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QvdThQphBXqCcRp7Ryx18O1gsRKM50Ng/view?usp=sharing">Link</a></p>  is to my final paper for this project. It was a brief study conducted during the summer in 2022 on Salamander abundance. Once I had collected all data, I cleaned and analyzed the data inside R. I created many occupancy models during my analysis and created a scatterplot to display my results which can be seen in the paper. My presentation of this project can be found <a href="https://www.acaweb.org/ledford-presentation-ethan-heck/">Here</a></p>
