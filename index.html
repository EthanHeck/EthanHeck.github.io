    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welome to my portfolio! I am currently a Senior studying biology looking to pursue biostatistics. Below are some of my previous projects done in a variety of languages such as R and Python. 
    <h2>Effects of Ecological Landscapes on Salamander Abundance in Southeast Kentucky</h2>
    <p>The first link below is a download to my final paper for this project. It was a brief study conducted during the summer in 2022. Once I had collected all data, I cleaned and analyzed the data inside R. I created many occupancy models during my analysis and created a scatterplot to display my results which can be seen in the paper. The second link below will direct you to the ACA's website where my presentation can be seen.
